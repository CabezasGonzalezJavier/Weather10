Description
-------
The application has two screens. In the application's main screen, 
the user can see a list of 10 cities with the type of weather and the current temperature. 
The user can tap on any of the cities and see more data about the weather such as the wind or precipitation data. 

 

Requirements:

- A working app should be delivered.

- A quick, sure and repeatable proof that every element of the code works as it should, should be delivered alongside the app.

- No restrictions are set to libraries, frameworks or languages. 

- No time restrictions are set, however, we expect this to be completed in a reasonable timeframe

- The application should be uploaded to a git service (several explanatory commits are valuable but not a requirement).
